# Finding Frequency
Given an array, you have to find the frequency of a number x.

Input Format

First line of input contains N - size of the array. The next line contains N integers, the elements of the array. The next line contains Q - number of queries. Each of the next Q lines contains a single integer X, for which you have to find the frequency of X in the given array.

Constraints

30 points
1 <= N <= 105
1 <= Q <= 102
-108 <= ar[i] <= 108

70 points
1 <= N <= 105
1 <= Q <= 105
-108 <= ar[i] <= 108

Output Format

For each query, print the frequency of X, separated by newline.
